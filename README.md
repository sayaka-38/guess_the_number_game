# guess_the_number_game

## Overview

This repository is a Python scripting exercise.
The script implements a simple guessing game where the user is prompted to input two numbers that define a range. A random number is generated within that range, and the user has a limited number of attempts to guess it correctly.

Please note that this script has minimal error handling and validation.
